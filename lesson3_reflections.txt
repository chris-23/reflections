Github:

syncing repos between local and GitHub

--> create empty repo on GitHub

called remote

push and pull commands:

always works on branches, pushes all the commits reachable by branch

git remote add --> adding new remote

git remote --> see all remotes

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

makes sense if people collaborate and/or you want to access your repo from differnt machines/places
