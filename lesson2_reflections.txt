Git files --> hidden files

Create repository: can be done locally

--> in directory you want to use run git init --> creates empty directory

Initialize: tells git to create an empty repository, doesnt commit anything

with git status you can see on which branch you are, which commit and which files are
untracked

git add --> add files to staging area, with next commit these files are commited
