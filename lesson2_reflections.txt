Git files --> hidden files

Create repository: can be done locally

--> in directory you want to use run git init --> creates empty directory

Initialize: tells git to create an empty repository, doesnt commit anything

with git status you can see on which branch you are, which commit and which files are
untracked

git add --> add files to staging area, with next commit these files are commited

manually choose what makes sense for the next commit --> not all files should be
commited (may some temp files or files specific for your machine)
makes sense to only add source file, not compiled stuff
